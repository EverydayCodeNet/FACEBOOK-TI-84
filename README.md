# FACEBOOK-TI-84
Starting off with a simple password system, I wanted to test the limits of the TI-84 calculator. Eventually, I found out how to use lists like databases for password management. This is the result.

## How to Download
1. Download the TI Connect CE Emulator.
2. Download FACEBOOK.8xp and LISTS.zip.
3. Connect the calculator with the USB cable. 
4. Click on the Calculator Explorer (papers) icon.
5. Drag and drop the files to the calculator.

#### Run Program Without Physical Calculator
1. Download TI Smartview.
2. Follow steps 2-5.
3. On the emulator, click pgrm and select FACEBOOK.

## Use & Customize

This version of the program was purposefully left empty for customization.
Using the Goto commands, you can run a program behind the login screen.

Example (abridged):
```
Prompt
If U=1234
Then
Prompt P
If P=4321
Then
prgmMARIO
```
